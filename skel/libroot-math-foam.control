Description: Compact Version of Cellular Event Generator
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently. 
 .
 The general-purpose self-adapting Monte Carlo (MC) event
 generator/simulator mFOAM (standing for mini-FOAM) is a new compact
 version of the FOAM program, with a slightly limited functionality
 with respect to its parent version. On the other hand, mFOAM is
 easier to use for the average user.
