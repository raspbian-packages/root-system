Description: metapackage to install all ROOT packages
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently.
 .
 With the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods
 can give direct access to the separate attributes of the selected
 objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are
 histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function
 evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the
 easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data
 interactively or in batch mode.
 .
 The command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the   
 programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++    
 interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link
 cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
 .
 This package is a metapackage to ensure the installation of all
 possible ROOT packages on a system.

 the density and - depending on the chosen methods - some additional
 information (like the borders of the domain, the mode, the derivative
 of the density ...). After a user has given this information an
 init-program computes all tables and constants necessary for the
 random variate generation. The sample program can then generate
 variates from the desired distribution.

Description: Splot library for ROOT
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently. 
 .
 A common method used in High Energy Physics to perform measurements
 is the maximum Likelihood method, exploiting discriminating variables
 to disentangle signal from background. The crucial point for such an
 analysis to be reliable is to use an exhaustive list of sources of
 events combined with an accurate description of all the Probability
 Density Functions (PDF).  
 .
 To assess the validity of the fit, a convincing quality check is to
 explore further the data sample by examining the distributions of
 control variables. A control variable can be obtained for instance by
 removing one of the discriminating variables before performing again
 the maximum Likelihood fit: this removed variable is a control
 variable. The expected distribution of this control variable, for
 signal, is to be compared to the one extracted, for signal, from the
 data sample. In order to be able to do so, one must be able to unfold
 from the distribution of the whole data sample.
 .
 The SPlot method allows one to reconstruct the distributions for the
 control variable, independently for each of the various sources of
 events, without making use of any a priori knowledge on this
 variable. The aim is thus to use the knowledge available for the
 discriminating variables to infer the behaviour of the individual
 sources of events with respect to the control variable.
 .
 SPlot is optimal if the control variable is uncorrelated with the
 discriminating variables.

Description: Toolkit for multivariate data analysis
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently. 
 .
 The Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) provides a
 ROOT-integrated environment for the parallel processing and
 evaluation of MVA techniques to discriminate signal from background
 samples. It presently includes (ranked by complexity):
 .
   * Rectangular cut optimisation
   * Correlated likelihood estimator (PDE approach)
   * Multi-dimensional likelihood estimator (PDE - range-search approach)
   * Fisher (and Mahalanobis) discriminant
   * H-Matrix (chi-squared) estimator
   * Artificial Neural Network (two different implementations)
   * Boosted Decision Trees
 .
 The TMVA package includes an implementation for each of these
 discrimination techniques, their training and testing (performance
 evaluation). In addition all these methods can be tested in parallel,
 and hence their performance on a particular data set may easily be
 compared.

Description: Numerical data analysis framework - general applications
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently. 
 .
 With the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods
 can give direct access to the separate attributes of the selected
 objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are
 histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function
 evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the
 easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data
 interactively or in batch mode.
 .
 The command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the   
 programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++    
 interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link
 cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
